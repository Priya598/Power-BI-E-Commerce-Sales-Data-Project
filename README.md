# Power-BI-E-Commerce-Sales-Data-Project
In this project, I analyzed E-commerce sales data using Power BI. I created interactive dashboards to visualize key metrics like total sales, number of orders, profit trends, top-selling products, and customer locations.
The project helps to identify sales patterns, profitable categories, and customer behavior for better business decision-making.
